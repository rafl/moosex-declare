  * Implement parameterizable roles.

0.24  Sat, 15 Aug 2009 23:48:09 +0200

  * Tests and doc fixes on applying multiple roles at once (Chas. J. Owens IV).
  * Produce better diagnostic output on test failures (Dave Rolsky).
  * Make MooseX::Method::Signatures handle the actual parsing for method-like
    keywords (nperez).
  * Clean now warns in autoclean namespaces (Robert 'phaylon' Sedlacek).
  * 'method' keyword now only available by default in namespaces that consumed
    MooseSetup (Robert 'phaylon' Sedlacek).
  * Added 'namespace' keyword and allow namespaces, superclasses and roles to
    be relative (Robert 'phaylon' Sedlacek).

  * Stop depending on B::Hooks::EndOfScope. We don't use it direectly anymore.
  * Add a real 'with' keyword.
  * 'with' in a class- or role-body doesn't defer role application until the
    end of the class- or role-definition anymore. The 'with'-option for the
    class and role keywords still does.
  * Add a tests for role application and method modifier ordering.
  * Make anon classes immutable as well (unless explicitly asked not to).
  * Add a ctx method to add cleanup code that should be injected as early as
    possible.
  * Depend on recent versions of DD and MXMS to make keywords less reserved
    (i.e. hash keys and barewords before fat commas).
  * Make t/with_newlines.t less noisy.
  * Add tests for methods with no signature not caring about their arguments,
    other than $self.

  * Add test to make sure methods returned from meta are
    MooseX::Method::Signatures::Meta::Method (nperez).
  * Add the actual ::Signature methods to the meta class instead of letting it
    wrap the coderef itself.
  * Make inner scopes inherit the declaration provider instead of hardcoding
    'MooseX::Declare' (Robert 'phaylon' Sedlacek).

    immutalisation.

  * Add TODO tests for creating nested anonymous classes and roles
    (nperez).
  * Always end injected code with a semicolon.
  * Only do namespace nesting if the inner namespace starts with "::".
  * Depend on D::D 0.005001 to get a skip_declarator that doesn't fail
    when code is being compiled between calling the linstr callback and
    skip_declarator. This appears to be necessary to work on 5.8.

  * Refactor - aka throw code away - by potring to
    D::D::Context::Simple (Ash Berlin).
  * Remove prototype from exported subs (Ash Berlin).
